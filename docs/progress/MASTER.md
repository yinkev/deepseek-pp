## Current Status

**Active Phase**: Phase 6 — Verification, Documentation, and Release Readiness.
**Active Task**: T6.1 / #205 — live Chrome smoke.
**Blockers**: Live Chrome extension smoke is waiting on user reload of the rebuilt unpacked extension at `/Users/kyin/Projects/Deepseek-pp/dist/chrome-mv3`. Latest passive Chrome preflight after the rendered XML-cleanup patch was `GO`; if a future preflight reports `NO-GO`, stop and record process evidence before live Chrome attachment.

## Governance Status

**Shared instruction surface**: `AGENTS.md`, auto-generated from Claude project memory. Do not hand-edit unless the sync source is also updated.
**Claude Code instruction surface**: no root `CLAUDE.md`.
**Other platform rule surfaces**: `.codex/` exists but no project skill files were found.
**Memory surface**: Codex native memory.
**Memory fallback path**: none. Do not create repo-local fallback memory unless explicitly selected.

## Execution Telemetry

Per-task telemetry should be written to the corresponding GitHub Issue as comments. Adaptive drift state lives in Milestone descriptions under the `adaptive` YAML block.

## Notes

- The old active Better DeepSeek capability spec was replaced in `docs/analysis`, `docs/plan`, and `docs/progress`; archived copy remains at `docs/archives/better-deepseek-capability-adoption/`.
- Browser-control tools should be implemented as local DeepSeek++ `ToolDescriptor`s with `browser_*` invocation names, not as external MCP tools.
- Chromium/Edge are the active target platforms. Firefox and Android must show explicit unsupported state and must not expose executable browser-control tools.
- Raw full Accessibility Tree snapshots must be budgeted and should not be stored directly in normal tool history.

## Next Steps

1. For Chrome, have the user reload `dist/chrome-mv3`, run `npm run smoke:chrome-preflight`, and only if it returns `GO`, run one natural live Browser Control smoke. Confirm Browser Control executes, the answer is correct, and visible assistant content contains no raw `<browser_snapshot>`, `<browser_evaluate_script>`, `<tool_calls>`, or `<task_complete>` text.
2. Close or update GitHub issues #189-#207 after review/merge policy is selected.
3. Re-run release validation before publishing any version that includes new Chrome permissions.

## Session Log

| Date | Session | Summary |
|:--|:--|:--|
| 2026-06-14 | Planning | Ran spec-driven Phase 0-4 for Gemini-Nexus parity browser control, wrote analysis and plan docs, created GitHub milestones #37-#42 and issues #189-#207, and initialized this tracker. |
| 2026-06-14 | Implementation | Added local `browser_*` tools, CDP/debugger connection, controlled tabs/groups, Accessibility Tree snapshots, browser actions, runtime/inline-agent integration, sidepanel controls, Chromium permissions, CWS docs, and automated validation. Live Chrome extension smoke remains pending. |
| 2026-06-22 | Runtime gate | Added passive `smoke:chrome-preflight` and operator notes so live Chrome smoke is gated on cool Chrome processes instead of perturbing a hot real session. |
| 2026-06-22 | XML cleanup gate | Live Browser Control smoke executed successfully but leaked raw browser-control XML in the visible assistant body. Added bounded rendered cleanup and legacy wrapper coverage, rebuilt all targets, passed full validation, and wrote `docs/progress/live-browser-control-xml-cleanup-handoff-2026-06-22T09-28-05-0700.md`. |
